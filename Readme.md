# using (r)age in the browser in a svelte app

## understand/ use material theming etc.
after managing to set the sass include path I need to further dig into how to use this, the current UI does not show the benefits of using all the dependencies compared to just handwritten html/js ;)

## further ideas:
Electron
https://github.com/Rich-Harris/svelte-template-electron
or more recent https://github.com/codediodeio/electron-forge-svelte

and maybe later

add signify compiled to wasm
